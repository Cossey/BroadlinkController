# Broadlink Controller

Connects to Broadlink Devices for IR code training.
This can also connect with unpaired devices and connect them to the specified network.

This is only been tested with Broadlink RM3 with the device code 0x5F36.
This is using a modified SharpBroadlink library for now (so that it works with RM3+ devices).

Please note that this is a work in progress.

Scanning, Training and pairing of devices works at the moment.
